Undergraduate senior in the School of Mathematics at Shandong University, scheduled to complete my BSc program in June 2025. In July 2025, I will commence doctoral studies in Mathematics at The Ohio State University.

My principal research focus lies at the intersection of algebra and topology, with particular investment in geometric group theory, and I maintain active interest in adjacent areas.
